# Personal Preferences

## Code Style
- 2-space indentation (not tabs) for most languages
- Single quotes in JavaScript/TypeScript
- No trailing semicolons in JS unless required
- Descriptive variable names over comments

## Shell Scripts
- Use Bash (not zsh)
- Always include `set -e` for safety
- Use `[[` over `[` for conditionals
- Quote variables: `"${var}"` not `$var`

## Git
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Don't amend pushed commits

## Communication
- Be concise - skip unnecessary preamble
- Show code changes, don't just describe them
- Ask before making large refactors

## Environment
- macOS with Homebrew
- Vim as default editor
- Solarized Dark theme preference
